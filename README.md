## Kanban Board App

## Technologies Used
Frontend: React, TailwindCSS
Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB

## Lessons Learned
I began to build a kanban board app in React before I had learned any backend. Now I have learned some and I want to try building it using this. I have decided to build the back and first and sort of start fresh and then bring in the front end and use code for my other repository to do that.

This will be the first time I have built a truly full-stack app-- I have decided to focus on backend first and completely develop that before starting on the frontend.

In thinking about the CRUD app:
- Create (POST): Adding tasks
- Read (GET): Showing tasks on board
- Update (PUT): Editing tasks
- Delete (DELETE): Deleting tasks
